      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Cybersecurity threats are becoming increasingly sophisticated, making traditional defense mechanisms less effective. Honeypots offer a proactive approach by acting as decoys that lure attackers, but conventional honeypots can be static and easy to identify. This project investigates the use of Artificial Intelligence to enhance honeypots, making them more dynamic, adaptive, and efficient in gathering threat intelligence.</p>

  <h2>Cum funcționează Honeypots</h2>
  <p>Honeypots sunt sisteme-capcană menite să atragă atacatorii informatici pentru a monitoriza și înregistra comportamente malițioase. Ele sunt separate de infrastructura reală pentru a preveni accesul neautorizat real și pot simula diverse servicii, sisteme de operare sau aplicații.</p>

      <h2>Why Integrate AI?</h2>
      <p>Artificial Intelligence can significantly improve honeypots by enabling them to learn from attack patterns and adapt their behavior in real time. Instead of using static configurations, AI-based honeypots can dynamically modify their surface (e.g., open ports, banners, OS fingerprints) based on observed attacker behavior. AI algorithms can also process large volumes of collected data to identify previously unknown threats, perform anomaly detection, and automate responses.</p>

      <h2>Benefits of AI-Based Honeypots</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Adaptive deception:</strong> Change behavior to stay undetected.</li>
        <li><strong>Improved threat intelligence:</strong> Identify new tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).</li>
        <li><strong>Automated analysis:</strong> Use machine learning to sort real threats from noise.</li>
        <li><strong>Reduced false positives:</strong> Improve the quality of detection and response.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Integrating AI into honeypot technology has the potential to revolutionize proactive cybersecurity. This research explores how dynamic, learning-based systems can be leveraged not only to detect threats but to understand attacker behavior in depth. AI-based honeypots can serve as intelligent, evolving shields that contribute to a more resilient security posture.</p>
