      <h2>About the Project</h2>
      <p>This project explores how Artificial Intelligence can enhance honeypots for better threat detection, deception, and response in cybersecurity.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
      <p>Traditional honeypots are static and easy to detect. AI can make them adaptive, smarter, and more effective against evolving threats.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Proposed Solution</h2>
      <p>We use machine learning models to analyze attack patterns and dynamically adjust honeypot behavior, improving realism and effectiveness.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Future Work</h2>
      <p>Integrating AI-based honeypots into large-scale SOC environments and combining them with threat intel feeds and behavioral analysis.</p>
